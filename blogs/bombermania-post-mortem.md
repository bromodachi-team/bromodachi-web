Hello - we’re Bromodachi; the developers behind Bombermania; and I’m Dat - the game designer of the team. Today, we’ll discuss the game itself - what are the goods, the bad, and the ugly, about this game.

## About the game
Bombermania is a mobile puzzle game, with a simple goal - to eliminate all enemies on the board. And the tools to achieve that goal are bombs - which would explode in sequence, based on the first placed bomb that would start the chained explosion.
To setup the chained explosion, you need to place the bombs onto the board by dragging, and manually press an explode button to set-off the explosion of the first bomb. If there’s any other bomb within the explosion range of the first bomb – that bomb would explode too, and will affect other bombs / enemies within its explosion range - and we have ourselves an explosion chain.
